4.58.4 (2026-08-30)
-------------------
* Update changelogs for 4.58.4
* Freeze 4.58.4: bump version (`#3548 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3548>`_)
* Update version to 4.58.4
* pass add_plug and use_mesh args to macro 435i (`#3520 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3520>`_)
* Merge branch 'ros2-development' into patch-1
* add use_mesh option in d455 camera (`#3521 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3521>`_)
* Merge branch 'ros2-development' into ileniap/add/use-mesh/d455
* Merge branch 'ros2-development' into patch-1
* push ros2-master to ros2-development (`#3543 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3543>`_)
* reset dev versions
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/ros2-master' into ros2-development
* Add D421 URDF model and mesh to realsense2_description (`#3534 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3534>`_)
* Merge branch 'ros2-master' into patch-1
* add use_mesh option in d455 camera
* pass add_plug and use_mesh args to macro 435i
  When starting simulation for d435i it wasn't possible to not use the mesh disabling the arg use_mesh. This led to gazebo crashing.
  Passed args 'use_mesh' and 'add_plug' from d435i to parent macro d435.
