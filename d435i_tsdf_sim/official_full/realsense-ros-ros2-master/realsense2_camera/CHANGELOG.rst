4.58.4 (2026-08-30)
-------------------
* Update changelogs for 4.58.4
* Freeze 4.58.4: bump version (`#3548 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3548>`_)
* Update version to 4.58.4
* Merge branch 'ros2-development' into ileniap/add/use-mesh/d455
* Merge branch 'ros2-development' into patch-1
* push ros2-master to ros2-development (`#3543 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3543>`_)
* reset dev versions
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/ros2-master' into ros2-development
* Ngoren/occupancy gridcells fix (`#3536 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3536>`_)
* fix(occupancy): symmetric grid centering and review cleanups
  - Center the grid about the camera axis with float cols/2 in both
  origin.y and the per-cell y: the integer division shifted odd-column
  grids (D585S emits 85 cols) half a cell laterally. Verified live:
  origin.y now -2.975 and the grid aligns with the point cloud.
  - Reject depth intrinsics with zero width, which would otherwise
  publish a silent all-unknown grid.
  - Stop the row scan at occupancy_max_range instead of skipping rows.
  - Drop the unreachable bin < 0 guard, document why it cannot trigger.
  - Rename bin_range to fov_span: it is the total FOV window, not the
  width of one bin.
  - Document occupancy_max_range in the README next to clip_distance.
* occupancy: require depth intrinsics, drop no-FOV fallback
* docs(occupancy): tighten comments
* refine(occupancy): odd-column origin consistency, near-range spread guard, cast and perf cleanups
* feat(occupancy): replace GridCells with OccupancyGrid, angular raycasting, FOV masking and max-range clipping
  - Switch occupancy publisher from nav_msgs/GridCells to nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid
  - Cell semantics: 0=free, 100=occupied, -1=unknown (was all-zero before)
  - FOV masking: cells outside horizontal FOV cone (from depth camera fx) → -1
  - True angular raycasting via θ=atan2(y,x) instead of fixed-Y column scan
  - Shadow propagation: free until first obstacle, unknown behind it per ray
  - Gap-ray fix: obstacle shadow spread across full angular footprint to prevent
  rays slipping through gaps between adjacent occupied cells
  - occupancy_max_range param (default 2.5m): cells beyond range → -1
* initial grid type adjustment
* LRS-1181: Make TF tests robust to split /tf_static publishing (`#3535 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3535>`_)
* cmake: add ROS 2 Lyrical to supported distros (`#3525 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3525>`_)
* Merge branch 'ros2-development' into worktree-remove-mqtt
* fix: track frame timestamp per-stream in HW clock mode (silences false reset warnings on DDS) (`#3531 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3531>`_)
* Remove PID whitelist in startDevice (let librealsense gate which cameras are supported) (`#3532 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/issues/3532>`_)
* fix: track previous frame timestamp per-stream to avoid false HW clock reset warnings
  The hardware-clock branch of frameSystemTimeSec compared every incoming
  frame's timestamp against a single shared _previous_frame_time. With
  multi-stream sources (e.g. DDS devices, where frames are tagged with
  RS2_TIMESTAMP_DOMAIN_HARDWARE_CLOCK), frames from different streams
  running at different rates interleave out of order against that one
  global value, triggering false "Hardware clock reset detected" warnings
  and spurious time-base resets on nearly every frame.
  Make _previous_frame_time a per-stream map keyed by the rs2 stream
  unique_id, so each stream's monotonicity is checked only against itself.
  On a real backward jump, clear the map so other streams re-seed silently
  against the new time base on their next frame.
  USB devices (GLOBAL_TIME domain) are unaffected — they don't enter this
  branch.

4.58.2 (2026-06-15)
-------------------
* Update CMakeLists.txt to 4.58.2
* Update package.xml to 4.58.2
* Update constants.h to 4.58.2
* PR `#3517 <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/issues/3517>`_ from Gilaadb: Imu handling in component
* Fix _imu_history state corruption on unite_imu_method change
  When switching between COPY and LINEAR_INTERPOLATION at runtime via the
  'unite_imu_method' parameter, _imu_history may contain stale entries from
  the previous mode. Clear it under _imu_callback_mutex to prevent corrupt
  IMU messages (e.g. a GYRO sample being used as accel data in COPY mode).
* PR `#3516 <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/issues/3516>`_ from AviaAv: Reset device at start of test_live_record_db3_play
* Shorten post-reset wait from 10s to 5s
* Fix race on time base variables in components (composable nodes)
  When using components, different sensor threads (video, IMU) can call
  frameSystemTimeSec concurrently on the same instance. The time base
  fields (_ros_time_base, _camera_time_base, _previous_frame_time) had
  no protection, so concurrent init or hardware clock reset could produce
  torn reads and inconsistent timestamp pairs.
  Folded the time base init and reset logic into frameSystemTimeSec
  behind a per-instance mutex, making it the single place that reads and
  writes the time base fields. Removed setBaseTime and the CAS-based
  init blocks in the callbacks, which had a publication window where one
  thread could read uninitialized values after another won the CAS but
  before it had finished writing. Converted _is_initialized_time_base
  from std::atomic_bool to bool since all accesses are now under the
  mutex and the atomic is no longer needed.
* Fix shared IMU callback mutex in components (composable nodes)
  When using components, different realsense cameras are part of the same
  process. The mutex guarding imu_callback_sync was a function-local
  static, so it was shared between all camera components and serialized
  unrelated callbacks across cameras.
  Moved the mutex to an instance member so each component has its own,
  and switched to std::lock_guard which is cleaner and better if an
  exception is ever thrown while the lock is held.
* Fix IMU message pollution in components (composable nodes)
  When using components, different realsense cameras are part of the same
  process. When using a static variable like was done in both unite
  methods, these variables are shared between the different camera
  components and all of them write to the same structure. It caused the
  published IMU messages to have the wrong data because it came from
  different camera sources.
  Moved the buffer to an instance member so each component has its own.

* Reset device at start of test_live_record_db3_play

* PR `#3507 <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/issues/3507>`_ from Nir-Az: align ros2-development to r/4.57.7
* versions fix
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/r/4.57.7' into ros2-development
  # Conflicts:
  #	realsense2_camera/package.xml
* Add dependency completeness check and fix missing deps
  Add scripts/check_package_deps.sh that validates package.xml declares
  all required dependencies. This catches issues the build farm catches
  but rosdep+apt misses (transitive deps mask missing declarations):
  - .action files require action_msgs in build_depend
  - find_package() calls need matching package.xml entries
  - rosidl_generate_interfaces DEPENDENCIES need matching entries
  The script immediately found two real missing dependencies:
  - realsense2_camera: missing rclcpp_action
  - realsense2_rviz_plugin: missing cv_bridge
