* Revert "TEST: Remove action_msgs dependency to verify CI catches it"
  This reverts commit 386560cee21b615ff722ca9faea55fcbdb99432f.
* TEST: Remove action_msgs dependency to verify CI catches it
  This commit intentionally removes the action_msgs dependency from
  realsense2_camera_msgs/package.xml to verify that the ros-core based
  CI detects missing dependency declarations. This commit should be
  reverted after verification.
